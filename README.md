# WebApi Project
this is basically a webApi project, developed using ASP.NET that covers almost everything you need to get started with coding in this area.<br/>
## Some of the ingridients of which this project is made of:
1.Model & controller
2.Repository
3.six most commonly used endpoint APIs i.e: Get, Get/{id}, Post, Put, Patch, Delete
4.Dependency Injection
5.Using arguably the most powerful ORM that is entity framework core to talk to the data base
6.DTOs(Data Transfer Object) and automapper to map out the models to DTOs & vice versa
and much more ...
